Doing projects during quarantine to strengthen knowledge of programming techniques and common courses taken around the world by millions through MIT Opencourseware.  
I have found the Algorithms classes excellent and challenging so I will continue to pursue online classes through Opencourseware. The projects will be completed as much as possible but moving on towards learning and understanding the languages presented to be able to see all sides and to prevent burnout is my learning preference. But where it is feasible without much direction and external help will I complete as thoroughly as I can the projects before moving on.

# Scratchpad  
Scratchpad is an amazing tool to help visualize programming concepts aimed towards users new to programming. It incorporates many elements of programming that are imperative for a functional turing complete system besides being able to compute mathematical processes(although it has lost of low level tooling that modifies variables). A turing complete system is one that have a finite length, read write capability, remembers current state, has a lookup table(scratchpad sorta lacks this) and has a transition state table and a logic process that can read symbols or variables, can modify these symbols, progress in instruction execution based upon these variables with logic processing using if-else and counted while loops. And can stay/go to another state based on a state table(scratchpad lacks this). It
